  <h1>My Hobby: Tennis</h1>

  <p>
    One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis. Tennis is a fast-paced sport
    that requires physical fitness, concentration, and strategy. I enjoy both
    singles and doubles matches, as each format has its own challenges.

    Tennis helps me stay active and improves my endurance, coordination, and
    reaction time. It is also a great way to relieve stress and clear my mind
    after a busy day.

    Another reason I like tennis is that it can be played both recreationally
    and competitively. Whether practicing serves or playing a match with friends,
    I always find it enjoyable.
